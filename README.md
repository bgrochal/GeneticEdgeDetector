# Genetic Edge Detector
Genetic Edge Detector is an application which implements a genetic algorithm for edge detection. This implementation has
been created on the basis of the article: *An edge detection technique using genetic algorithm-based optimization* written
by Suchendra M. Bhandarkar, Yiqing Zhang and Walter D. Potter. Full text of the paper is available at the 
[researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222477449_An_edge_detection_technique_using_genetic_algorithm-based_optimization)
portal.

## Requirements
You need to have `python 3.4+` installed (tested on `3.5.2` version). If you want to install dependencies using 
`requirements.txt`, you also need to have proper version of `pip` installed (tested on `8.1.2` version for `python 3.5`).

## Installation and Commissioning
Open the command prompt in the main directory of the application and type:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 edgedetector\genetic_edge_detector.py 
```
