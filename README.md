# Genetic Edge Detector
Genetic Edge Detector is an application which implements a genetic algorithm for edge detection. This implementation has
been created on the basis of the article: *An edge detection technique using genetic algorithm-based optimization* written
by Suchendra M. Bhandarkar, Yiqing Zhang and Walter D. Potter. Full text of the paper is available at the
