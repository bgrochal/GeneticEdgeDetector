# Genetic Edge Detector
Genetic Edge Detector is an application which implements two genetic algorithms for edge detection. These implementations 
have been created on the basis of the articles: 
  - *An edge detection technique using genetic algorithm-based optimization*, written by Suchendra M. Bhandarkar, Yiqing
  Zhang and Walter D. Potter (available at the [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222477449_An_edge_detection_technique_using_genetic_algorithm-based_optimization)
  portal);
  - *Optimal edge detection filter using genetic algorithm*, written by R. M. Naife and H. H. Abass (available on the 
  [Web](http://www.iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&aId=100469)).

## Requirements
You need to have `python 3.4+` installed (tested on `3.5.2` version). If you want to install dependencies using 
`requirements.txt`, you also need to have proper version of `pip` installed (tested on `8.1.2` and `9.0.1` version for 
`python 3.5`).

## Installation and Commissioning
Open the command prompt in the main directory of the application and type:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py 
```
Please note that the algorithm to be used may be changed simply by editing the `run.py` script.
